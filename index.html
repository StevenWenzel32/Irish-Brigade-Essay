  <h1 align="center">What was the Irish brigade and how did their involvement in the Civil War affect the view of Irish immigrants in the United States?</h1>

  <h2 align="center">1) How were Irish immigrants treated before the Civil War and why did they come to the United States?</h2>
  
   <p>In the 1830s the Irish had many reasons for leaving Ireland. One reason was that the British had created an oppressive 
    government that the Irish had tried to overthrow many times. They were the lower class in their own country and discriminated 
    against because of their race and for being Catholic. Essentially the British had become greedy landlords and the Irish the 
    poor tenants ("Immigrant Soldiers"). Education in Ireland was very bad and was a huge reason why many families left the 
    country. Another reason was that they could not practice their religion freely in Ireland now that the British were in charge. 
    Finally, from 1845 to 1850 the potato famine struck which caused thousands of Irish to starve and many soon fled to other 
    countries that were willing to take in people who needed food and a safe place to live (Craughwell 10). All together Ireland 
    just wasn’t the right place to be living in the mid-1800s with so many disasters happening, so the people just had to find 
    somewhere where they would be safe and could live with fewer everyday struggles.            
   
   <p>The United States was an attractive option for the Irish as there were many jobs available in the quickly growing country. 
    Something that motivated Irish families to move to the United States was that their children could go to a public school and 
    then if they could afford it they could send them to a Catholic college (Craughwell, 20). They could also practice their faith 
    freely in the United States, unlike Ireland. Brave Irish men had also heard word of the Irish Brigade. Thomas Francis Meagher 
    had started it with the purpose of training good fighting Irish soldiers to eventually take back Ireland (Mullin 54). These 
    brave men who wished to take back Ireland started to head to the United States with the intent of joining the Irish brigade and 
    learning how to fight. Most Irish that went to the United States settled where they landed and only moved a couple cities till 
    they found a new home. This meant that most Irish immigrants settled in New York, Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts 
    (Meltzer 29). Many of the Irish immigrants were farmers back in Ireland,  and did not have any useful skills for living and 
    working in big cities, so they became part of the working poor as the men and young boys would take the most dangerous and 
    menial jobs. The women and young girls would clean houses and do other things around the house as servants for the wealthy 
    citizens (Craughwell, 20). Once the Civil War began, the North needed supplies and soldiers. Supplies, such as uniforms, guns, 
    bullets, boots, belts, hats, etc. were always in high demand this, in turn, made many more jobs available in the big cities in 
    the North such as New York (Dublin 9). The Irish that were a little hesitant to go to the United States soon left Ireland 
    knowing that they would have a good job real fast. Among those that were already in the United States when the war supplies 
    went in high demand, some became rags to riches stories. (Biel 58). The start of the Civil War and the resulting job 
    availability in the United States gave Irish immigrants more hope that they could be successful in the New World and provide for
    their families.  
   
   <p>The treatment that the Irish immigrants received when they got to the United States before the Civil War was horrible. The 
    Irish were not welcomed when they got to the United States in fact far from it, they were greatly discriminated because of their
    race and for being Catholic. Anti-Irish feelings soon spread everywhere and they were treated poorly, looked down on, and 
    considered unwelcome outsiders. ("Immigrant Soldiers"). Since thousands of Irish immigrants were coming to the United States and
    most of them were working poor, tensions rose between them and the other immigrant groups. The Irish immigrants were willing to 
    work the worst jobs for very little pay, this upset many Americans because they thought the Irish were outsiders and they didn't
    want their jobs to be going to the foreigners or outsiders. This also upset the middle working class because there was now more 
    working poor than the middle working class so they started to get replaced by the working poor who would work for less pay 
    (Biel 59). When the Irish brigade was first established before the Civil War, some questioned their loyalty to the United 
    States, especially when they refused to march in a parade honoring the Prince of Wales who was visiting the United States. 
    (Mullin 54-56). This shocked people and made them even more suspicious of the Irish brigade. The Irish were not treated well 
    in their first couple of decades in the United States. Americans seemed to always be mad at them for one reason or another 
    taking their jobs, their race, their religion, and the list goes on.
 
  <h2 align="center">2) What was the Irish Brigade?</h2>

  <p>The Irish brigade formed for one reason at first but in the end, they formed for many more. At first, the Irish brigade was 
   started by Thomas Francis Meagher to train to take back Ireland (Mullin 54-55). To convince more of his fellow Irishmen to join 
   the brigade Thomas Francis Meagher said that they owed it to the United States because they took them in during their time of 
   need and that they should fight for the United States army (Scott). Again Thomas Francis Meagher had to do something to get more 
   men to join so he started to put up posters asking for more Irish recruits and he went around saying that they should fight to 
   prove themselves to the Americans and show them that they should not be discriminated against because they could fight just as 
   well as the Americans and that they were just as brave as them (Mullin 58-59). In the end, the Irish Brigade was formed for 3 
   reasons and was able to meet two of those goals and prove themselves to be true fighting Irish. If they did not have these 
   reasons they would not have formed the Irish brigade. These reasons were based on how they were treated in Ireland, the United 
   States, and their bad fortune along the way without this there would have been no Irish brigade.    
 
  <p>The Irish brigade was made to be an all Irish fighting unit hence the name and was indeed that till the end. The Irish Brigade
   was made up of all Irish volunteers. These volunteers were Irish immigrants from New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and many more 
   cities along the east coast (Mullin 54). The Irish Brigade was made up of twenty all Irish soldier regiments, no other race was 
   in the Irish brigade at the time when they first formed even their chaplains were Irish ("Immigrant soldiers"). The Irish brigade
   was soon known for their toughness and bravery in battle. At one point at the end of a battle the Irish brigade was in there were
   only five men left in a company (Alexandria Gazette)  The Irish brigade remained all Irish until they had lost so many men in the
   battles, they had 4,000 all Irish soldiers in the Irish brigade in total and at the end of the Irish brigade there were about 250
   all Irish troops left. What was left of them got joined by another brigade to get their numbers back up and that was when the 
   Irish brigade ended.

 <h2 align="center">3) Why did the Irish brigade get involved in the Civil War and how did they influence the union?</h2>

  <p>Picking a side to fight for wasn't easy for the Irish Brigade. Most Irish did not agree with the North and why they were 
   fighting, but they didn't want to join the South because if Britain thought the South would win they would join them. The North 
   knew that the Irish mostly agreed and related to the south and if most of them joined the south they would surely lose the Civil 
   War. So to stop that from happening Union officials had to give the Irish enlistment bonuses and other advantages to get them to 
   join the North since most did not support the North's cause (History.com Staff). Once the North had made a blockade to prevent 
   the South to continue trade with Britain, so they would not have the funds to keep fighting. This made the British textile 
   industry badly hurt and Britain need the cotton from the south, so they threatened to join the South. When the Irish living in 
   the United States heard this most joined the Irish brigade which joined the North, but some joined the South because they 
   understood how they felt fighting against an oppressive government (Scott). Eventually, the Irish immigrants living in the North 
   that weren't in the army had to enlist to be a United States citizen or pay a $300 fee. Most of the Irish were working poor so 
   they could not afford this ("Immigrant soldiers"). Most of the Irish joined the north but some joined the south and it was indeed
   a sad time for them because they would be killing their own brothers. If it weren’t for the Irish Brigade we might have lost the 
   war. 
  
  <p>The Irish Brigade had influenced the Union in multiple ways. One way was that it was tradition to fight honorably and with 
   heroism in Ireland and as the Irish brigade showed this time and time again it soon stuck with the Union. (Mullin 59) The day 
   after the Irish brigade was sent to take Marye's heights at the battle of Fredericksburg. A correspondent of the London times 
   was there that day and saw them fight, he later wrote that no other brigade and no other race deserved the glory and honor the 
   Irish brigade had earned that day. Also, that correspondent was on the side of South and it's quite rare for someone to appraise 
   their enemy (Mullin 60-61). The Irish Brigade had touched many people's hearts and made them realize that they were some very 
   honorable and influential soldiers.    

  <h2 align="center">4) What lasting effects did the Irish brigade have on the Irish in the United States after the civil war?</h2>
  
  <p>The Irish Brigade has had many lasting effects on the treatment of Irish and the United States. The Irish brigade was right 
   there ready to help the North when the Civil War begins and this helped the Irish who were not out fighting to be accepted in 
   the United States (Mullin 55-56). The Irish brigade fought honorably and took on the most dangerous and challenging assignments, 
   they were always in the most influential and important battles. If it wasn't for them we would have lost the battle of Gettysburg
   and possibly lost the war. At one point George Alfred Townsend the novelist said: "When anything absurd, forlorn, or desperate 
   was to be attempted, the Irish Brigade was called upon."(Scott). The actions of the Irish Brigade made a huge impression on the 
   citizens of the United States which made some things change right away, but sadly that was not a lot but it was still an 
   improvement.   
  
  <p>The treatment of the Irish after the Civil War was truly amazing and had a lasting effect on the United States. After the 
   Civil War, the Irish brigade had made some of the anti-Irish feelings in the United States start to go away (Mullin 61). In the 
   next decade or so the Irish started to get more respectable jobs such as law enforcement, construction, teaching, and operating 
   saloons and restaurants. Finally, by the 1900s the anti-Irish bias in the United States had just about completely vanished and 
   they were no longer discriminated and considered outsiders (Craughwell 214). Irish Brigade had done it they were able to convince
   most of the United States that they shouldn’t be treated as outsiders and that forever changed how the Irish were viewed and 
   treated in the United States.
